            I was curious how a diet conforming to USDA
            <a href="https://fnic.nal.usda.gov/dietary-guidance/dietary-reference-intakes"
            >Dietary Reference Intakes</a> may look like.
            I mean not only your usual protein, fat and carbs, but also a
            zillion other microelements and vitamins.
            To compute that diet, I needed a tool which can tell me in
            what proportions shall I mix regular food products from my local
            grocery store to meet the DRI requirements.
            It'd also be nice if such combination of products is the
            cheapest one.
            In other words, I needed to solve a variant of the classical
            <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stigler_diet"
            >diet problem</a>.
            I couldn't find an open-source tool for that, so I built
            one myself.
            Have fun with it, you fellow nutrition maniacs!</p>

          <h2>Examples</h2>
          <p class="text-justify">
            Here's the diet I computed for myself using the products from
            local and online stores.
            I was so excited, I even ended up eating this stuff for quite
            a while!
            Prices are of the time of writing of course, they've changed
            since then.<br>

          <p class="text-justify">
            Just for fun, I also computed a diet meeting the same requirements
            as above, but composed of random products from USDA National
            Nutrient Database.
            There's no price information in it though.<br>

            It's a Python library.
            Through its API you define the goal as acceptable ranges for
            each element, specify which products to compose the diet of,
            run the solver to find the cheapest solution,
            and save the report.</p>
          <p class="text-justify">
            Runs on Arch Linux, but with a reasonable amount of
            <a href="https://github.com/diethack/diethack">effort</a>
            can be built on Windows, Mac OS X and many Unix-like operating
            systems.</p>

            Finds in what proportions you need to mix the food products, so
            that all micro- and macroelements are within acceptable ranges,
            and the result is the cheapest possible.</p>

            Per-product mass limits.
